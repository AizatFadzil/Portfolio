Conclusion get from the Data Vizualization :

The conclusion notes that despite the general trend of younger players playing more minutes, there is significant variation among the young players in Selangor Football Club. Specifically, it notes that 11 young players played below the team's average of around 800 minutes, while 5 young players played above the team's average. This suggests that age alone may not be the only factor that determines playing time, and that other factors such as skill level and experience may also play a role. The conclusion also notes that coaches and team managers may want to take a more holistic approach to evaluating players and making decisions about playing time, rather than relying solely on age as a factor.

While the overall pace of vaccinations has been encouraging, there is still a long way to go in achieving herd immunity and controlling the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.
